              <FormHelperText>
                Having one of our adoptees in your home for socializing. A separate application must
                be filled out for each foster bird in addition to this application. If you are
                fostering for the Refuge, the Refuge maintains legal custody of the foster bird(s).
                You will be expected to take care of all the needs of the bird(s), which will
                include food, medicine, veterinary care, toys, etc., without remuneration. If you
                need financial assistance in caring for the bird(s), we will provide you with the
                necessary funds. In agreeing to foster, you will not be reimbursed for expenses
                after the fact unless there has been an agreement with the Executive Director. If
                the Executive Director determines that it is in the best interest of the bird, the
                bird(s) will be returned upon demand of the Executive Director. If the Refuge needs
                to take legal action to obtain the bird(s), you, as the volunteer, will reimburse
                the Refuge for any and all expenses related to regaining custody of said bird(s).
